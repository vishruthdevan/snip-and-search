# snip-and-search
An extension to snip a part of the screen and image search the snipped picture  

Note: chrome.tabCapture is undefined on service worker, this is still an open [bug](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1214847), so this extension cannot be made with Manifest V3 until the bug is resolved.
